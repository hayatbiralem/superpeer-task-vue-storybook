# My Qualifications

## I love CSS, Math and solving problems.

Because of that I mostly like puzzle based games like [Chess](https://www.chess.com/), [7 Billion Humans](https://store.steampowered.com/app/792100/7_Billion_Humans/), etc. But I have to admit, I'm also a fan of [Hollow Knight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/) too.

I also like to calculate things to solving problems my own way. For example please look at [this carousel](https://rebootworks.com/hrpeak/v14/#testimonials) at desktop, I made the circular motion by only (s)css and you can add/remove items.

## I've been coding CSS since 2010.

My strength has always been front-end.

## I know back-end stuff too.

I also know NodeJS, PHP, Laravel, WordPress, bash and servers...

Because I always love to learn and challenge myself.

## My English Level

#### Reading, Writing and Conversational English

I've been talking to Cambly teachers for two years now (you can verify that by following [this link](https://www.cambly.com/en/certificate/verify/f8478219)), so I'm good at listening and speaking too. I am comfortable in daily conversations but I must say that my vocabulary and grammar are poor.
