# Finding UI Developer ⚔️🔥🔥🔥

This is a story about how the [Superpeer](https://twitter.com/superpeer) found [their UI Developer](https://github.com/hayatbiralem), I hope :)

## Storybook

I follow [this tutorial](https://www.learnstorybook.com/intro-to-storybook/vue/en/get-started/) to build this Storybook which is awesome.

## Vue

I tried to follow the Vue's Official [Style Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/) especially naming conventions.

## CSS Architecture

I used the [InuitCSS](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/) Architecture based on ITCSS and BEM Methodology to cover [More Transparent UI Code with Namespaces](https://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/).

InuitCSS is not a CSS Framework like Bootstrap, it does not contain any cosmetics.

## Clean Folder Structure

Components (without styles), stories, and styles have their own directories.

```

├── components/
│   ├── fields/
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   ├── BaseFormFieldButton.vue
│   │   ├── BaseFormFieldSelect.vue

│   ├── _common.scss
│   └── main.scss
└── utils/
    ├── pascalCase.js
    └── polyfills.js
```

## Tools

- I make a tool named [SVGV](/?path=/story/docs-svgv--page#svg-what) to export SVG Icons as Vue Components like @svgr/cli. [Learn more &raquo;](/?path=/story/docs-svgv--page#svg-what)
- I make a SASS Mixin to solve a common issue on mobile named `prevent-zoom-on-focus-fix`.

## CSS Modules (partly)

I used the [CSS Module](https://css-tricks.com/css-modules-part-1-need/) approach <ins>without scoping styles</ins> because we have already scoped all of our components using namespaces as outlined above, so we do not need to scope our styles that never conflicts.

## Code of Conduct

- I used comments to make things clear in HTML and CSS.
- I tried to use semantic syntax and accessibility attributes.
- I tried to make usefull Vue components.

## Performance

- I used inline SVG.
- I used responsive images.
- I used mobile first approach.

## User Experience (for Testers)

- I made sure that the real mobile experience can be tested at widths of 479px and below.
- I sent simple closure functions to the buttons via VueJS.
- I've generate SVG Icons as Vue Components via CLI.

## Bugfix Diary

- I checked Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, IE11, iOS Safari/Chrome, Android Default/Chrome browsers.
- I fixed the [select apperance issue at IE11](https://gist.github.com/vladimirsiljkovic/ef176cae54d3c4d1992907e1e0723210).
- I fixed the [iOS Safari input zoom problem](https://thingsthemselves.com/no-input-zoom-in-safari-on-iphone-the-pixel-perfect-way/#:~:text=The%20cause%20of%20this%20issue,size%20is%20less%20than%2016px) caused by the input size being 15px (below 16px) and I made a SASS mixin for it.
- I couldn't solve the text ellipsis issue at select elements on IE11 with only CSS but I could with some Javascript by following [this approach](https://nikitahl.com/text-overflow-ellipsis-on-select-tag/).
- I fixed Object doesn't support property or method 'assign' error on IE11 by using [related pollyfill](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39021339/1227926).

## Pixel Perfect

I tried to achieve pixel perfect by using screenshots as layers in Photoshop.
