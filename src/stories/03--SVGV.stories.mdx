# SVG What?

React has a great tool to export SVG icons as React Components: [@svgr/cli](https://react-svgr.com/docs/cli/).

You can look at [the training video](https://youtu.be/2W_qXpQJ_Ng?t=583) prepared by [Adem Ä°lter](https://twitter.com/ademilter) to see how it works.

Unfortunately, Vue does not have a tool like that, yet.

So I decided to make a simple Vue version of it by using pure NodeJS and I made it: SVGV!

## Usage

You can put your new icons into the `public/icons` directory and simply run

```bash
yarn icon
```

..to export Icons as Vue Components under the `src/components/icons` directory with index.

## Template

You can use icon component in templates like this:

```html
<BaseIcon icon="LineUser" />
```

or

```html
<BaseIcon icon="line-user" />
```

Both do the job.

You can add attributes as many as you want like this:

```html
<BaseIcon icon="line-user" width="18px" height="18px" style="color: red;" />
```

## CLI

```bash
Usage: node tasks/svgv.js -s [source path] -t [target path]
Usage: node tasks/svgv.js --source=[source path] --target=[target path]

Options:
      --help     Show usage                                            [boolean]
      --version  Show version number                                   [boolean]
  -s, --source   Source path                                            [string]
  -t, --target   Target path                                            [string]
```

## TODO

- [ ] Make a standalone github repo
- [ ] Add full CLI interface
- [ ] Publish to npm directory
