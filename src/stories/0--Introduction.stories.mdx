# Finding UI Developer ‚öîÔ∏èüî•üî•üî•

This is a story about how the [Superpeer](https://twitter.com/superpeer) found [their UI Developer](https://github.com/hayatbiralem), I hope :)

## Vue & Storybook

I follow [this tutorial](https://www.learnstorybook.com/intro-to-storybook/vue/en/get-started/) to build this Storybook which is awesome.

## CSS Architecture

I used the [InuitCSS](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/) Architecture based on ITCSS and BEM Methodology to cover [More Transparent UI Code with Namespaces](https://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/).

InuitCSS is not a CSS Framework like Bootstrap, it does not contain any cosmetics.

## CSS Modules (partly)

I used the [CSS Module](https://css-tricks.com/css-modules-part-1-need/) approach <ins>without scoping styles</ins> because we have already scoped all of our components using namespaces as outlined above, so we do not need to scope our styles that never conflicts.

## Code of Conduct

- I used comments to make things clear in HTML and CSS.
- I tried to use semantic syntax and accessibility attributes.
- I tried to make usefull Vue components.

## Performance

- I used inline SVG sprite.
- I used responsive images.
- I used mobile first approach.

## User Experience

- I made sure that the real mobile experience can be tested at widths of 479px and below.
- I sent simple closure functions to the buttons via VueJS.
- I've generate sprite icons via CLI.

## Bugfix Diary

- I checked Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, IE11, iOS Safari/Chrome, Android Default/Chrome browsers.
- I fixed the [select apperance issue at IE11](https://gist.github.com/vladimirsiljkovic/ef176cae54d3c4d1992907e1e0723210).
- I fixed the [iOS Safari input zoom problem](https://thingsthemselves.com/no-input-zoom-in-safari-on-iphone-the-pixel-perfect-way/#:~:text=The%20cause%20of%20this%20issue,size%20is%20less%20than%2016px) caused by the input size being 15px (below 16px) and I made a SASS mixin for it.
- I couldn't solve the text ellipsis issue at select elements on IE11 with only CSS but I could with some Javascript by following [this approach](https://nikitahl.com/text-overflow-ellipsis-on-select-tag/).
- I fixed Object doesn't support property or method 'assign' error on IE11 by using [related pollyfill](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39021339/1227926).

## Pixel Perfect

I tried to achieve pixel perfect by using screenshots as layers in Photoshop.

## My Qualifications

- I love CSS, Math and solving problems.
- I've been coding CSS since 2010.
- I also know NodeJS, PHP, Laravel, WordPress, bash and servers... In short I know back-end stuff.
- I'm good at reading and writing in English. I've been talking to Cambly teachers for two years now (you can verify that by following [this link](https://www.cambly.com/en/certificate/verify/f8478219)), so I'm good at listening and speaking too. I am comfortable in daily conversations but I must say that my vocabulary and grammar are poor.
